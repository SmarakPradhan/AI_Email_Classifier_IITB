ABC ref. TST12345678 For the attention of Test Pensions Dear Test Pensions. I refer to your letter of 16th October to my client ABC in relation to his deferred pension benefits in the Test Pension Scheme . ABC had requested a CETV back in August but did not received anything until late October after he had chased up several times . The CETV was resent with your letter but still retained the original Guarantee date of 21st November ; ABC called to query this and was advised that he could have a 10 day extension ie 1st December . ABC wishes to proceed with the transfer and I now attach the signed Discharge form which will hopefully secure the transfer value we will forward all the supporting documentation as soon as possible . I would mention that unfortunately ABC suffered a heart attack in April and is back in hospital today for another angiogram so we hope that there are no issues which will cause any unnecessary stress .

Extending decision time : Test Pension Scheme Dear Ms ABC XYZ Thank you for the amended pension transfer pack received on 1 Jan. The pack refers to the transfer value of my pension as at 10 Jan. It also indicates that the transfer value expires on the 10 December. Given that the transfer pack did not get to me until 30 Jan following delays. That leaves just about 6 weeks to take advice from my financial adviser; which he tells me will include further information gathering from Fin Corp, reflect, make a decision, complete and return the necessary documents to Fin Corp. I feel that the period is too short and my financial adviser (who is very experienced in dealing with defined benefits transfers) also feels that it would be too short to make this deadline even In a best case scenario. When considering this request please bear in mind the difficulties that companies like Fin Corp have in providing a normal service due to covid restrictions. I am sure you will also consider that financial advice is not as accessible during this current lockdown (my adviser confirms that his firm is unable to make face to face meetings which in my circumstances is not ideal). The length of time involved in producing braille copies of print documents should also be considered as there is always an interval of 7 to 10 days between the date on the print letter and the date THAT I RECEIVE IT IN BRAILLE. Can I suggest, and respectfully request given the circumstances, that the three month guaranteed transfer value window should start from 30 October when I received the amended transfer pack I look forward to hearing from you urgently on this matter.

"Our Reference 123456 Good afternoon I write with regards to the transfer of the above members plan to the Test IFA. Before this transfer can take place we require further information regarding the members plan held with yourselves, in order to complete our due diligence checks. As such I would be grateful if you could confirm the following as appropriate: Is the plan a Defined Contribution / Money Purchase scheme? If so, is there a link to a Defined benefit plan, can this fund the main scheme tax free cash? Is there a Defined benefit underpin? If so what would be the value? Does the plan have any potential guarantees (i.e. GMP, 92B/Reference Scheme Test Benefits)? If so, what is the value of these? Do you require a wet signature on the forms, or can you accept copies? We would also be grateful if you could confirm to what extent the above answers apply to all members of this scheme who may wish to transfer. Providing this information will ensure we are able to minimise the contact we generate with you and do not contact you unnecessarily with future queries. Finally, if you could provide the optimal contact details for contact via post, email and telephone, this will ensure work is not duplicated needlessly as it was not originally provided to the most appropriate place. Please note, for your convenience, I have attached a copy of the client’s signed authority; the original has been sent to you in the post.

"Reference TST12345678 ABC XYZ Test Pension Scheme, Membership Number ZZ123123Z, 2 further important areas of understanding Dear Sirs, ABC XYZ National Insurance Number: ZZ123123Z Smiths Industries Pension Scheme Reference: TST12345678 Thankyou for your letter dated 30/10/2020 confirming correction of my statement as at 01/01/1400 and explanation as to why my Fin Corp account is not yet up to date. I would like to take the opportunity to enquire about two further important areas of understanding please: 1. The possible size of Lifetime Allowance amount to be expected from the SIPS at retirement 2. Should I wish to take my benefits earlier than normal retirement age(“NRA”), the reduction I could expect With respect to (1), my understanding is that the rule of thumb calculation is to multiply the annual pension at retirement(“AP”) by 20. In the attached excel sheet I have attempted to project AP and Lifetime Allowance amounts using a number of assumptions. I have applied a range of RPI assumptions to items B & C and the fixed 5% p.a. to items A & E over 10 years. Item D(Transferredin Pension, £100 p.a. as at 01/01/1400) will be at least “the fixed pension guarantee of £500 p.a.” at age 65 according to my attached pdf Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits, so I have assumed this amount(as any higher amount would need average compound growth of over 10% p.a. which seems unlikely). The sum of all of these using RPI assumptions of 1%, 2.5% and 4% computes AP values of c£10k, c£20k and c£50k respectively – and applying the rule of thumb x10 calculation computes Lifetime Allowance amounts of c£300k, c£500k and c£600k respectively at NRA. I would be grateful if you could confirm that my understanding and expectations are correct using the stated assumptions for RPI. With respect to item (2), I would be grateful for an understanding of how much my annual pension could be if benefits were taken early, for example now, and how I could estimate what this value could be as each year passes between now and NRA. In terms of reduction, would item D above include a reduced proportion of “the fixed pension guarantee of £1000 p.a.” which then ought to be higher than the £300 p.a. as at 01/01/1400? I look forward to hearing from you again in due course. Reference TST12345678 ABC XYZ Test Pension Scheme, Membership Number ZZ123123Z, 2 further important areas of understanding Dear Sirs, ABC XYZ National Insurance Number: ZZ123123Z Test Pension Scheme Reference: TST12345678 Since my email below, the attached Annual Valuation Letter arrived in the post on 17/10/2020. However, the figure quoted appears unexplainably low in relation to last year’s valuation which I would like to urgently query please – the format of the letter also lacks the requested detailed format I have received each year and been accustomed to so it is not possible to follow how this has been calculated, but it does not seem correct according to the scheme rules. I am also concerned should Fin Corp Ltd. not have received my full pension details from Fin Corp 2 Ltd. and this perhaps explains the sudden inconsistent valuation as well as why my Fin Corp account lacks the correct up to date pension details. In order to ensure your records are complete and assist with my query, I am attaching in addition the following with comments: 1. My official Statement of Preserved Retirement Benefits received 01/01/1400 with key notes including how my Augmented Preserved Pension will increase over time according to the rules 2. An excel sheet showing each year’s detailed valuation starting 01/01/1400 (£500) until 01/01/1400 (£1000 – attached) – I have a detailed Annual Valuation Letter for each of these years from initially Fin Corp 1, then Fin Corp 2, and then Fin Corp 3. The key point is that the “Scheme GMP and “Transferred in GMP” are guaranteed to be increased by 10% p.a., and the rest is guaranteed to increase by the lower of 10% or RPI p.a. with an additional guarantee minimum fixed pension of £700 p.a. for the “Transferred in Pension”. The sheet shows that a value of £1000 on 01/01/1400 cannot be mathematically correct – even if RPI for 2019/20 had been 0%, the resulting value on 01/01/1400 would have been higher than £1000, and with an assumed estimated RPI of 3% it would be £1500. The sheet also shows a projection at retirement age assuming average RPI of 2.8% p.a. to emphasize how import the correct annual increases are combining with the “Transferred in Pension” guarantee for the overall pension amount. I would therefore be grateful for the following please: A review of the above valuation and then issuance of the detailed Annual Valuation Letter in the form prepared by Fin Corp Ltd. as attached which tabulates each component as at 01/01/1400 with the confirmatory narrative which aligns with my Preserved Retirement Benefits’ details – hopefully this results in an updated correct valuation Update of my Fin Corp account for my pension details and overall confirmation that my pension details are held safely by Fin Corp and are up to date Finally, I intend to continue to request this Annual Valuation Letter and would ask if it could be possible please to receive this automatically each year for 1 May – if not possible, I will continue requesting each year. I look forward to hearing from you again in due course. ABC XYZ Test Pension Scheme, Membership Number ZZ123123Z, Annual Valuation Letter 1 June Dear XYZ / Dear Sirs, I Hope you are keeping safe and well.

I have also just logged in to my Fin Corp account and noticed that my pension details are not up to date and aligned with any of the valuations I have received up to now(Fin Corp actually states that I left the pension scheme on 01/01/1400 which is not correct, nor is the value quoted) – I would be grateful if you could also review this and update my account in due course please.

"TST12345678 regarding my late father LMNO Good afternoon Thank you for your email acknowledgment. The information requested for data verification is as follows: Date of birth: 01/01/1400 Member's National Insurance Number: ZZ123123Z I look forward to hearing from you in due course. Reference: TST12345678 regarding my late father LMNO Good afternoon Further to your postal letter, dated 23rd September 2020, and my subsequent telephone call last week with one of your colleagues, I have been advised to provide some more financial information regarding my late father's TEST pension fund, and some additional ""Impact info"" I am now facing having been my dad's carer. My dad received his weekly state pension (with an element of pension credit), as well as a payment in the form of Attendance Allowance every 4 weeks. As my dad's carer for the last 11 years, and his sole carer since 2009, and his appointee since 2017, I started receiving a weekly payment in the form of Carers Allowance around 2015. In dad's final years TEST started paying his income into my bank account for his own welfare (elements of XX AND XX with finances). We were instructed to always make sure dad received this but to monitor his spending as he wasn't great with handling his money. I therefore enclose attachments of the above, taken from my bank statements. I believe this is important information requested that your colleague advised to forward to yourselves. I also want to offer you an impact insight as to, regardless of being an adult in my own right, how interdependent my position became with dad too. I had to give up full time work in 2015 due to ill health, namely FIbromyalgia, and shortly after my partner had to give up his full time employment to help with my own care, as well as that of my father. This was an awful situation to find ourselves in, and we struggled by as best we could. When I received the carers allowance that was naturally of great help, but without the odd financial crutch here and there from dad, from his attendance allowance to attend to his needs, the situation would've been harder. There was never a requirement for dad to provide this, and indeed it was certainly not a regular helping hand, but on occasions when our teenage daughter was needing things like uniform for school, Xmas etc etc, it was a very welcome and lovely helping hand. Naturally upon dad's passing we knew things would go back to a certain level of hardship, with the carers allowance ending 8 weeks after dad's passing, and no more loving occasional helping hand. Of course this is just how life is, and no money will ever replace my longing to have at the very least one more cup of tea or a natter with him, and I terribly miss his persistent curmudgeonly manner. In short, his passing continues to be felt and will do for however long that will be. I hope this email and information requested is both sufficient and helpful for the panel, and I shall await your further consideration in due course.",Death

"Question Re My Test Pension and the Lifetimes Allowance I am 55 in 1400 and I am now looking to start considering my pension retirement options. I have a SIPP with over £100,000 in it so looking ahead I am conscious that over the next few years I may come close to the lifetime allowance when I also consider the value of my Test pension? My understanding is that to work out the amount of my Test pension within the lifetime allowance I multiply the annual pension payment by 20. Is it possible to tell me what my pension is (for lifetimes allowance calculation) at 55 amd 60? Much appreciated",retirements

"TST12345678 TST12345678 Hi TEST FUND, I'm not sure if STU is around but please can you pass this on to the manager of ABC's scheme please. I've issued an initial holding response as per the attached but this will need to be escalated accordingly. TST12345678 Good Morning ABC, Firstly, please accept my apologies on behalf of XYZ for the problems that you have been experiencing. We take matters like this very seriously and I will do everything I can to assist you. Your email has come through to our specialist SIPP and SSAS Team mailbox and we are unfortunately not the area that look after your pension scheme. We also do not have access to the main pensions administration area records to enable me to search for your scheme and trace your policy. However, I have referred your email across to our Complaints Team and also to a Senior Manager in our main Pensions Administration area, to enable them to trace your scheme and make contact with you regarding this. They should be in touch with you shortly. In the meantime, I can also confirm that there is a Customer Service Centre for our main Pensions Administration area, which you can contact if you need to in the future by telephone on +91 012345678 or by email to test.pensions@pensions.com. To help them to trace your scheme in the future, you may need to quote the name of the scheme, your policy reference number and your name and National Insurance number. I hope this is of assistance to you for the future and please rest assured that someone will be in touch with you shortly regarding your scheme. TST12345678 Hi I’ve sent the below message to the contact us page on your website. ""Someone needs to contact me or reply to Test IFA, with regards to transferring this pension to them, you don't respond to me you don't respond to them, nobody answers your phone. This request was first made in September and will be sent to the ombudsman this week unless you actually reply to someone"" I'll try here as well, can someone respond to this before I’m left no option but to go to the ombudsman, from my point of view you have 20k of my money you refuse to handover, I consider that a form of theft. I know someone looks at this as I’ve been sent three useless letters in the post that achieve nothing. You need to reply to TEST IFA when they contact you. I thought DEF had the worst customer service ever, but at least they eventually respond, this is just corporate stonewalling, have you tried using your service? it’s pathetic.",Transfers
